Interactive Shiny Dashboard to Display Prescriptions per 100,000 
Shinyapps link: https://amarsee.shinyapps.io/opioid-prescriptions/

This shiny dashboard has an interactive map to display prescriptions per 100,000 people of each state in the US. The data is from a 2014 survey of 25,000 doctors' prescription habits. 

There is a drop down menu of the opioids included in the data set.

The option selected will result in a map created on the right hand side side of the page.

Below is an example of the map for Fentanyl

Two tables are also updated based on the selection of the opioid. They display the Top 5 highest presription rate states (shown in red) and the Bottom 5 lowest prescription rate states for that opioid (shown in green)
